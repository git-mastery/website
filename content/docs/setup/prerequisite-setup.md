{{% hint info %}}
This guide assumes that you are using [Git Bash (for Windows)](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or the terminal (for MacOS and Linux) as we will be using bash commands.\

If you are facing issues with running certain commands (especially on Windows), please consider using Git Bash instead.

## Git

Follow the installation steps for your [operating system (OS) here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

To ensure that everything is working, run the following commands:

```bash
git version
```

You should see text like this:

```bash
git version 2.48.1
```

Once Git is setup on your local machine, do some initial configuration:

```bash
git config --global user.email "<your email>"
```

```bash
git config --global user.name "<your name>"
```

## Github

Setup Github by following the instructions below.

1. Create a [new Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) _if you donâ€™t have an account_
2. Connecting to [Github with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
   1. Generate a new SSH key
   2. Add the SSH key to Github

To verify that Github is working, refer to [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection?platform=mac) and run the given command (`ssh -T git@github.com`) to ensure that your SSH connection is working correctly.

## Setting up Git Mastery

Once you have completed the setup for Git and Github, please refer to the [next guide to setup Git Mastery for your local machine](/docs/setup/git-mastery-setup)!
