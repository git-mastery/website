# Welcome to Git Mastery!

{{% hint info %}}
Git Mastery is designed to provide students with a strong intuition for how the Git version control system works through practical problem sets designed to run entirely on their local machines.

## Why Git Mastery?

From teaching Git to over hundreds of students, we have noticed that the primary pain point that many students have when learning Git for the first time is finding the right practice for Git commands. Without appropriate practice, students will forget the myriad of Git commands that are covered.

Git Mastery aims to address this issue by providing deliberate practice through carefully designed problem sets that aim to engage students and provide them with exposure to many practical scenarios.

## Credits

The lesson contents were adapted from the [NUS Hackers Orbital Git workshop material](https://wiki.nushackers.org/orbital/git) (because [Jiahao](https://woojiahao.com), the primary developer of Git Mastery was the person who had also written the NUS Hackers Orbital Git workshop material).
